# NetworkTool

NetworkTool is a web application built on Ruby on Rails so that users can add contacts and set text reminders to reach out to them for specific occasions. Utilized Twilio API for texting; Twitter Bootstrap for responsive design; Heroku for deployment. Will be adding the project URL shortly.
